## Design

The website was created to provide users a visual impression of the online games.

### Colour Scheme

For the colour theme, yellow is a warm, primary colour with a lot of energy that may make your website appear welcoming and cozy. Pink is a vibrant, striking color that may be used in the ideal combination to draw viewers to your website as soon as it loads.

### Fonts 

Lato is an excellent typeface for websites since it comes in a variety of styles and is very readable. Both typefaces are thought to be good for dyslexics.

Oswald works nicely as a complement. It is that seductive and hospitable. Due to its little elongation, it always gives contrast to a typographic combination.

### Structure

The website's layout was created to be simple to understand and use. Every game screen is contained within the same enclosure and has a consistent aesthetic throughout.

### The game's screens are as follows:

#### Science word guess
- The chosen letters are placed in vacant boxes on the word guess screen.
- There is room below for incorrect letter selections and attempts at guessing.
- You are given a hint to help you guess the word.
- Below that are buttons that will direct you to the following selected scientific phrase to guess.

#### Science word guess
- You are given a hint to aid with word guessing after the chosen words are scrambled and placed in the   
  center of the screen.
- A timer is provided to keep the user focused and engaged. - A space is provided below for inaccurate
  letter choices and guesses.
- The buttons below that will direct you to either check the word or select a different scientific phrase.
- A reset button to reload the page is located beneath it.

- A contact page with a contact form that enables users to email the developer with questions or comments 
- A separate 404 error page
